Till is a cache server for immutable, time-limited object storage. It provides
a simple interface via HTTP to put and get binary blobs and up to 4kB of
metadata. Till smoothes over the different interfaces for cloud object storage
and provides you with a simple set of HTTP methods for accessing your cache.

This is a Node.js library for interfacing your Javascript code with a Till
server.
